# hello-world
Hello-World is my 1st repository. It will contain facts/information about me. 
I am Tradeesia but I prefer to go by Teej. I am a 3rd year psychology major and AMSL minor from greenville, South Carolina. I am going to be a Cardiologist and dabble in sports medicine as well. I love sports, my favorite team is the New orleans Saints. I also love performing arts, I would love to learn how to play the piano. I focused on vocal instrumentation growing up, but I know how to play the flute and violin as well.
